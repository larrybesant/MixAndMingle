# 🎯 FINAL SETUP STEPS - Authentication Fix Guide

## ⚠️ Current Issue
The SQL error you're seeing (`policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" already exists`) indicates that RLS policies were already created but may be conflicting. 

## 🔧 Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Updated SQL Script
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `database/simple-auth-fix.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** - this script safely handles existing policies by dropping and recreating them
4. **Look for success message**: "AUTH FIX COMPLETE! ✅ You can now create accounts and log in"

### Step 2: Test Authentication
1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000/signup
2. **Try signing up** with a test email and password
3. **Check your email** for confirmation (if email confirmation is enabled in Supabase)

### Step 3: Debug if Issues Persist
1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000/auth-debug
2. **Check the connection status** and error messages
3. **Verify Supabase settings** in your dashboard

## 🎯 Next Steps After Auth Works

### 1. Complete MVP Testing
- Test signup/login flow
- Test room creation at `/go-live`
- Test streaming functionality
- Test the matching system

### 2. Configure Daily.co (if not done)
- Add your Daily.co API key to `.env.local`:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key_here
  ```

### 3. Deploy to Production
- Follow the checklist at `/mvp`
- Use the deployment script: `./deploy.sh`
- Test on your live domain

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Email confirmation required"
**Solution**: In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings:
- Disable "Confirm email" for testing
- Or check your email for confirmation links

### Issue: "Invalid login credentials"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're using the email/password you just created
- Check if email confirmation is required

### Issue: Database connection errors
**Solution**:
- Verify `.env.local` has correct `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Check Supabase project status in dashboard

### Issue: Daily.co rooms not working
**Solution**:
- Verify Daily.co API key in `.env.local`
- Check Daily.co dashboard for API limits

## 📝 Environment Check
Make sure your `.env.local` contains:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators
✅ You can create an account at `/signup`
✅ You can log in at `/login` 
✅ You can access `/dashboard` when logged in
✅ You can create rooms at `/go-live`
✅ Database connection works at `/api/health`
