# 🌐 djmixandmingle.com Domain Resolution Guide

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS
- **Live Beta Link**: https://mix-and-mingle-qw6yjxf28-larrybesants-projects.vercel.app
- **Domain Issue**: djmixandmingle.com is assigned to another Vercel project/account
- **Your Vercel Account**: larrybesants-projects (0 domains currently)

## 🔍 DOMAIN CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### Step 1: Check for Multiple Vercel Accounts
Do you have another Vercel account? Check:
- Any other email addresses you might have used
- GitHub account linked to different email
- Google/social login with different email

### Step 2: Check Domain Registrar Settings
1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Check DNS settings for djmixandmingle.com
3. Look for any Vercel nameservers or CNAME records pointing to Vercel

### Step 3: Contact Vercel Support (if needed)
If you can't find another account:
- Email: support@vercel.com
- Subject: "Domain djmixandmingle.com stuck in another project"
- Explain: You own the domain but can't add it to your project

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS (Choose One)

### Option A: Quick Professional Beta Link (5 minutes)
Buy a similar domain for $12/year:
```bash
# Suggested domains:
- djmixmingle.com
- mixmingle.app  
- djmixandmingle.app
- mixandmingle.live
```

Then add to Vercel:
```bash
vercel domains add yourdomain.com
vercel alias yourdomain.com
```

### Option B: Use URL Shortener (30 seconds)
Create a branded short link:
1. Go to bit.ly or tinyurl.com
2. Shorten: https://mix-and-mingle-qw6yjxf28-larrybesants-projects.vercel.app
3. Custom back-half: mixmingle-beta or djmixmingle

Example: bit.ly/djmixmingle-beta

### Option C: Subdomain Solution (if you control DNS)
If you can modify DNS for djmixandmingle.com:
1. Create subdomain: beta.djmixandmingle.com
2. Point CNAME to your Vercel URL
3. Add subdomain to Vercel: `vercel domains add beta.djmixandmingle.com`
