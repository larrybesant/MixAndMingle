## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/matching/potential`

Returns potential matches for the current user

- **Response**: Array of user profiles with preferences
- **Status**: Currently returns mock data

### POST `/api/matching/swipe`

Records a swipe action (like/pass/super_like)

- `user_preferences`: User matching preferences
- `profiles`: Extended with `date_of_birth` for age calculation

### Triggers & Functions

- Auto-match creation on mutual likes
- Notification generation for new matches
- Potential match finder function

## Next Steps

### High Priority

   - Run migration scripts on Supabase
   - Test table creation and relationships
   - Verify RLS policies

2. **Connect Real Data**
   - Replace mock APIs with database queries
   - Implement proper user filtering
   - Add swipe history tracking

3. **Enhanced Matching Algorithm**
   - Filter by music preferences
   - Location-based matching
   - Age range preferences
   - DJ vs non-DJ filtering

### Medium Priority

1. **User Preferences Page**
   - Settings for matching criteria
   - Distance preferences
   - Music genre selections

2. **Photo Upload Integration**
   - Profile photo management
   - Multiple photo support
   - Image optimization

3. **Real-time Features**

   - Online status indicators
   - Typing indicators

### Low Priority

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Super like limitations
   - Match expiration
   - Profile verification
   - Boost/premium features

## Technical Notes
