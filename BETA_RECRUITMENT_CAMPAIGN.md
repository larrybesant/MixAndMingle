### 🎮 **Email #2: Community Leaders**

**Subject:** "Create visually stunning communities (beta access inside)"

```
Hey [Name],

As someone who understands community building, I thought you'd appreciate this:

We've built what might be the first truly visual, real-time community platform that doesn't suck on mobile.

🎨 Think:
• Custom avatars & banners for every community
• Drag & drop image uploads (actually smooth)
• Live member counts and real-time notifications
• Mobile-first design that rivals native apps

🏆 Perfect for:
• Interest-based communities (music, gaming, fitness)
• Local groups and meetups
• Professional networks
• Creative collaborations

💡 We need community leaders like you to test this and tell us what's missing.
