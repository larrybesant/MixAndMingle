## 📋 **What Happened:**

### ❌ **The 405 Error:**
```
Failed to send password recovery: Unexpected status code returned from hook: 405
```

**Root Cause:** Supabase is trying to call a webhook/auth hook that either:
- Doesn't exist
- Returns 405 "Method Not Allowed"  
- Is misconfigured in your Supabase dashboard

### ✅ **Automatic Resolution:**
Our smart hybrid system detected the Supabase failure and **automatically switched to Resend**:

## 🔧 **Optional: Fix Supabase Hook (Advanced)**

If you want to eliminate the 405 warning entirely:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Project → Authentication → URL Configuration
   
2. **Check Auth Hooks:**
   - Look for any webhook URLs
   - Ensure they accept POST requests
   - Or disable auth hooks if not needed

3. **Common Issues:**
   - Redirect URLs pointing to GET-only endpoints
   - Invalid webhook configurations
   - CORS issues with custom domains
